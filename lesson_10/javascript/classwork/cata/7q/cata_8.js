/* Basic JS - Calculating averages */
/*
 Let's build a calculator that can calculate
 the average for an arbitrary number of arguments.

 The test expects you to provide a Calculator object
 with an average method:

 Calculator.average()

 The test also expects that when you pass no arguments,
 it returns 0. The arguments are expected to be integers.

 It expects Calculator.average(3, 4, 5) to return 4.
