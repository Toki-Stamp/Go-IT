/* Detect Pangram */
/*
 A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter
 of the alphabet at least once.
 For example, the sentence
 "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
 is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z
 at least once (case is irrelevant).

 Given a string, detect whether or not
 it is a pangram. Return True if it is,
 False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.
